# Text_Detection_and_Text_Recognition

# DETAILS
1. Detection of faces using Haar cascade, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), MMOD (Max-Margin Object Detection), and SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)
2. Detection of other objects, such as eyes, smiles, clocks, bodies, and cars
3. Recognition of faces using Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms), and advanced Deep Learning techniques
4. How to compare the performance of the algorithms
5. Build your custom dataset capturing faces via webcam
