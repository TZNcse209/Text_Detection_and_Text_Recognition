# Text_Detection_and_Text_Recognition

Detection of faces using Haar cascade, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), MMOD (Max-Margin Object Detection), and SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)
Detection of other objects, such as eyes, smiles, clocks, bodies, and cars
Recognition of faces using Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms), and advanced Deep Learning techniques
How to compare the performance of the algorithms
Build your custom dataset capturing faces via webcam
